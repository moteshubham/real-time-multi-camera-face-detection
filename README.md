# real-time-multi-camera-face-detection
a microservices-based dashboard application where users can register cameras by  providing RTSP URLs, view live camera feeds via WebRTC directly in the browser, and  receive real-time face-detection overlays on those streams. Face detections trigger alerts,  instantly sent to the frontend via WebSockets.
